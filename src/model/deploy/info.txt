When you implement a new module, update the template.yml to include its handler and resources (e.g. AWS Lambda), then create a builder in the builds/ folder.

To test it,
use only the build_all_containers script first. 
go to the test/ folder and create some test for the new module following the other examples.

To deploy,
you can use the Main script, which automates the process using the other scripts.
