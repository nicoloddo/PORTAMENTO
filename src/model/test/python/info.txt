The process in which these tests can be executed is:

1. test_fetcher: Fetches the songs from the given test list of playlists using Spotify's API
2. test_merge: Merges the pickle files in a pandas dataframe. The dataframe is then saved as .csv. You can check if the fetched pickles actually represent the data you were retrieving.
3. test_clusterer: Clusters the data with the chosen hierarchical tree clustering algorithm, which can be set in the clusterer_test_config.json file. For now, the only available algorithm is the Portamento BIRCH.
4. test_navigator: Navigates the structure of the hierarchical tree built by our clusterer

test_utils is a utility library for the tests.
